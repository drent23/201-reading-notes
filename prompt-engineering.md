# ### Instruction ### List the commands to put a unit in the extended rectangular formation
- The response from ChatGPT included some commands that are different than the commands used in the Army, but they are still descriptive and thorough.
" The specific commands to put a military unit in an extended rectangular formation may vary depending on the military branch, doctrine, and equipment used, but here are some general commands and steps that are commonly used:

1. **Halt**: Bring the unit to a halt if it's in motion. This command ensures that all soldiers stop moving and prepares them for formation.

2. **Extend**: The command to "extend" is given to spread the formation out laterally. This is the foundation of the extended rectangular formation.

3. **Rectangular Formation**: The specific rectangular formation may have variations, but it typically involves arranging soldiers in rows and columns, with a specified distance between each soldier. The dimensions of the formation are determined by the mission and terrain.

4. **Adjust Spacing**: Soldiers should be instructed to adjust their lateral spacing to maintain the desired interval. This can be done by commanding "Adjust Interval" or "Adjust Lateral Spacing."

5. **Maintain Alignment**: Ensure that soldiers maintain proper alignment by using the command "Maintain Alignment." This is crucial to maintain a rectangular shape.

6. **Cover Down**: Command "Cover Down" to ensure that soldiers maintain the appropriate front-to-rear spacing while forming the rectangular shape.

7. **Dress Right (or Left)**: Depending on the direction of the formation, command "Dress Right" or "Dress Left" to align soldiers correctly in their respective rows and columns.

8. **Ready, Front**: Use the command "Ready, Front" to ensure that all soldiers are facing forward.

9. **Stand Fast**: Finally, issue the command "Stand Fast" to hold the formation in place.

Keep in mind that specific military units and doctrines may have their own variations and nuances when it comes to formations. The above commands are a general guideline for establishing an extended rectangular formation, but they should be adapted to the specific needs and practices of the unit in question. Additionally, the formation may be adjusted as the situation and tactical requirements change."
